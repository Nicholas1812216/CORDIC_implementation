# CORDIC_implementation
A fixed point implementation of the CORDIC algorithm that accepts a range of inputs (pi/2 to 0) in radians in signed Q2.15 format.
The sin and cos outputs are in the same format. This repository also contains logic to display the outputs via seven segment display
on Xilinx's NEXYS4 DDR board.
